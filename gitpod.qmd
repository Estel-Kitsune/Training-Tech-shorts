## What is Gitpod

Gitpod is a developer environment that runs in your browser. In order to use it, you need a Git repository (either on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket). Gitpod opens up a container on your Git repository.

There are different pricing depending on your needs such as:  

- Free plan (50 hours per month)

- Pas-as-you-go  

- Company plan (custom)

NBIS does not have a Gitpod account. Mahesh has an open source plan (nammed NBIS).
